        <h1>My Hobbies' List</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Shopping</b></li>
            <p>Shopping is one of my most favorite hobbies, since I was a teenager.</p>
            <p>I especially enjoy going shopping with my husband when we go to the mall. I like to see new fashion styles and accessories in particular.</p>
            <p>When I don't have enough time to go outside for shopping, I do go online to see what is trending and available.</p>

            <li><b>Playing board games</b></li>
            <p>I enjoy playing board games with my family.</p>
            <p>It is a time of lots of laughing, talking, and competing against everyone.</p>
            <p>Everyone enjoys it and I do too, especially when I win!</p>

            <li><b>Dancing</b></li>
            <p>I enjoy dancing while listening to music. It is also a form of exercise for me.</p>
            <p>In the future, I would like to take dance classes with my husband.</p>
            <p>I always wanted to learn the Salsa, Tango, and Bachata dances.</p>
